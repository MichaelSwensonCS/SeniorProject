<b>Summary</b>
<br>
Groove is a place for music lovers of all types to come together and experience a community like never before. Users will enjoy a smooth and intuitive software that will help connect them with incredible events and other music fans.  In addition to everyone's favorite music features, Groove provides unique tools that will make attending concerts with friends extremely easy. 

<h2>Abstract</h2> 

News and information about music events are scattered between many different platforms.  Venues, streaming sites, file hosts, and geographic locaters all offer different information about upcoming events but each one lacks services the others offer.  Groove would be a central platform that would make finding events, connecting with people who have similar music tastes both in person and online, and giving people music event related content an intuitive, streamlined experience. 
<br>
This centralized platform also gives us the opportunity to provide novel features focusing on social communities. The ability to see other users review of venues, organize ticket sharing, view what other people are posting about your favorite bands, links to your favorite bands, physical proximity event alerts, and many more never before seen features to delight our users.
<br><br>
<b>Who is this software for?</b>
<br>
This software is for people who love music, enjoy a night out, or chatting about shared interests with others online.
